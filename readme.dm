## Overview
The **Hospital Appointment Scheduler** is a system designed to manage patient appointments efficiently.  
Patients can enter their symptoms or directly choose a specialization (e.g., cardiology, surgery, dermatology).  

The system will:
- Match symptoms to the appropriate medical specialization.
- Consider doctor availability and working hours.
- Distribute patients fairly among available doctors (balancing patient load).
- Suggest the nearest available appointment slot based on appointment duration.  

This documentation will be gradually expanded as new features are implemented throughout the course.
